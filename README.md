# CIS3319DESLab1

##Structure
There are two runnable classes, a sender and receiver. The sender class takes a few inputs for connecting through a socket, generates a key, and sends the
cipher-text. The receiver class takes inputs for connecting as well, takes a key, and decrypts the cipher-text. The functions relating to the DES
scheme such as 'encrypt', 'decrypt', and key generation are separated into a DESUtil class.
